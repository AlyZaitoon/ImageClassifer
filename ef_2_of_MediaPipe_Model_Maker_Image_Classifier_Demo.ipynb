You can do this by trimming down a public dataset to only the classes that are relevant to your usecase, compiling your own data, or some combination of both. The dataset can be significantly smaller that what would be required to train a new model. For example, the [ImageNet](https://www.image-net.org) dataset used to train many reference models contains millions of images with thousands of categories. Transfer learning with Model Maker can retrain an existing model with a smaller dataset and still perform well, depending on your inference accuracy goals.

        "Below is a summary of our benchmarking results for the supported model architectures. These models were trained and evaluated on the same flowers dataset as this notebook. When considering the model benchmarking results, there are a few important caveats to keep in mind:\n",
        "- The test accuracy column reflects models which were trained with the default parameters. To optimize model performance, experiment with different model and retraining parameters in order to obtain the highest test accuracy. Refer to the [Retraining parameters](#retraining_parameters) section for more information on customizing these settings.\n",
        "- The larger model architectures, such as EfficientNet_Lite4, may not acheive the highest test accuracy on simpler datasets like the flowers dataset used this notebook. Research suggests that these larger model architecture can outperform the others on more complex datasets like ImageNet, for more information, see [EfficientNet paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11946.pdf). The ImageNet dataset is more complex, with over a million training images and 1000 classes, while the flowers dataset has only 3670 training images and 5 classses.\n",
